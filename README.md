Worship songs for iOS
================

This is an app for iOS. It is for worshippers to view the song lyrics on their iPhone and iPad devices. It is under development and available in App Store. Developer snapshots are available [here](#).

If the projected screen is far away and you want to view the song lyrics on hand held device or you may wish to carry the song lyrics where ever you go. Either way, this app for iOS helps you do this.

On starting every time, it attempts to fetch latest songs from internet. The downloads contains both Tamil and English Christian worship songs which can be used in churches. After downloading, the songs are available for you to search and or open one of the songs from the list. Songs lyrics displayed are in regular and romanized Tamil.

View of the lyrics displayed can be changed with respect to text size, style, and type. You may also set the colour for primary language and secondary language.

While worshipping you can set the screen to be awake such that there won't be a need to touch the device often.

Worship songs uses [OpenLp](http://openlp.org) database schema.
